# Idea-Box-Triples

## Project Description

For this project we were asked to recreate the comp of the Turing Idea-Box, and add functionality that allowed for viewing ideas, creating ideas, deleting existing ideas, editing existing ideas, changing qualities, filtering by text and importance, and showing most recent ideas. 

### Our Biggest Challenge

Our biggest challenge with this project was saving our ideas to local storage. After researching saving to local stroage, revisiting our class lecture notes, and asking classmates and upper mod students, we were able to succeed in saving our ideas to local storage, as well as edits and quality changes. 

### Our Biggest Success

Our biggest success was getting all of our quality buttons functional, and getting our input and text areas to clear when ideas had been saved.
